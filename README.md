Real-Time Detection of Trending Topics via Multi-Source  Aggregation and Natural Language Processing

In the age of information overload, real-time detection of trending topics is vital for content creators, media analysts, and digital strategists. This paper proposes a real-time system that performs multi-source data aggregation and natural language processing (NLP) to identify emerging trends from diverse platforms including Reddit, NewsAPI, GNews, and RSS feeds. The system features dynamic data ingestion, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis using VADER, named entity recognition (NER) with spaCy, keyword extraction, and topic modeling to deliver meaningful insights. An influence scoring mechanism is incorporated to rank content based on engagement signals and semantic relevance. The system supports time-based filtering and keyword-specific searches, enabling responsive and context-aware trend tracking. Evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the systemâ€™s ability to capture high-impact topics with semantic precision and temporal relevance. The architecture is modular and interface-agnostic, allowing deployment across various front-end frameworks. This work contributes a scalable and extensible framework for real-time trend detection through integrated NLP and data fusion techniques.
